_Light Bulb designed by A.Dinagar from the Noun Project - www.thenounproject.com_

We divided this book into thematic, independently readable sections that let you dig right into the part that is most relevant to your current objective. The six main sections try to cover the spectrum of considerations, practical methods and responsible data challenges in different phases of a project. While sections sometimes refer to other parts of the book, each module can be read independently. Should you prefer to read the book in the traditional way, the sections follow a narrative logic that is closely related to different steps of the project evolution.

##Designing a project

Thinking responsibly about data during a project is good, doing so before is even better. Designing a project to inherently accommodate responsible data practices works best. This section gives checklists, ideas and methods to inform your planning phase. It provides practical suggestions for thinking about risk assessment, threat modelling and budgeting to help you implement responsible data practices.

##Managing data

Any step of the project data flow will need to consider the management and storage of information. This section looks into how data is stored, where it is archived, who can access it and atthe possible legal ramifications and risks associated with storage.

##Getting, understanding and sharing data

These sections get into the main pipeline of the project data flow. From zero to publish: what are the risks, perils, pitfalls,  resources, tools and techniques you can use to develop a trusted, secure data flow that takes into account consent, agency, privacy and ethics.

##Closing a project

Harm can originate from zombie projects, abandoned databases, orphan sites and online ghost towns. This section is about getting closure: about secure disposal, archival and evaluation of your project.
