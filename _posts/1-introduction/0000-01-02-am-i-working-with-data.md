Yes, you are. Almost certainly. If information is in any way meaningful for the work you do, and if you plug anything into a power source, you are likely working with data.

##What is Data?

When we think of data, we often imagine large amounts of information that are formally collected, stored in a database or stashed in an Excel spreadsheet. Data is any kind of "value that is assigned to a thing", and can take a variety of forms.

So...this is data:



As is this:



But so is this:



...if you are studying LOL cats.  

Pictures and videos online are perhaps the most obvious examples of new data, but we generate data all time. Writing emails, sending text messages, automated GPS tracking on our phones. Data is everywhere, whether we recognize it or not. For this toolkit, data is any kind of information that can be communicated and learned from, whether or not we call it data.

##Who is in your data?

When thinking about responsible data, it's worth giving special attention to data about people. Data that reveals personal identities, habits, activities or affiliation is the most obvious point of care for responsible data practices. There are a number of data points that attach to individuals. At minimum, a person has a name, date of birth, weight, height, nationality etc. As more data is generated through a variety of mechanisms, however, there are all kinds of data that say something about who we are and how we behave, and often this data does not identify individuals in obvious ways.

But, data about people can include some unusual suspects; even data that doesn't have names could still potentially be related to people. In fact, even removing all personally identifiable information from a data set isn't necessarily enough to protect identities in that data set. With the increasing sophistication of analytical techniques and algorithms, de-identified data sets can be combined with other supposedly anonymous data to re-identify individuals and the data associated with them. This phenomenon, known as the Mosaic Effect, is particularly challenging because evaluating the risk of it occuring requires one to anticipate all the different types of data that exist or may be produced, and which could be combined with that data set, which simply isn't possible.

Even data that does not identify individuals can still reflect identities and behaviour of groups and communities. Managing this data responsibly can be just as important as data about individuals, especially when data about those groups (where they reside, how they identify, what they do) might exacerbate social tensions, support discriminatory policy or incite violence.

Case study: wanting to act as an independent watchdog on the Election Commission of a country, an NGO set up an election monitoring platform, asking people who they were voting for. The information was intended to be anonymous, but if that data set was accidentally made public, and somehow combined with other data sets, it may well be possible to work out who voted for whom. This kind of information could be potentially very interesting to various political parties, and, dependent upon the political climate, could be dangerous for the individuals from whom it was gathered.

##Whose responsibility is it anyway?

In short: yours.

Anyone producing, managing or sharing data that reflects on individuals has a responsibility to do so in a way that respects the rights and dignity of people reflected in the data, and avoids doing harm. During a typical development project, this will involve a number of team members working across the project life cycle, from planning to data collection, analysis, publication and outreach. Thinking about these issues can be difficult, and it's a reasonably new area of thought; to do this responsibly requires a concerted effort by all team members, especially bringing together different disciplines and perspectives.

Project managers have a key role to play here, and official responsibility will always rest with the person (or entity) who can legally and organisationally control the data process. Ensuring appropriate and responsible processes will require the input and engagement of researchers, communications focal points, technical staff, enumerators and local consultants.

Managing data responsibly is not simply the task of one person: it's an overarching theme to be considered throughout (and after!) the lifecycle of a project.
