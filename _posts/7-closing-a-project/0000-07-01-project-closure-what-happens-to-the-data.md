Projects end for many reasons. Funding cycles may close. Project goals might be achieved. Even if a project has not ended, the data lifecycle may end during a project, when data no longer needs to be collected and/or referenced in the project.

In all instances, projects that have a data component must address the end of the data lifecycle. **Deciding what to do with the data after it has served its purpose is an integral part of the project design process and should be informed by the risk assessment.** Usually, this will encompass the following:

* Mapping where the data is and ensuring it is only in places where it should be
* When collected data has been be shared (internally or externally), ensure that responsible data procedures are upheld after closing
* Disposing with (parts of) the data or archiving it, either internally or externally

Where possible, decisions about data sharing, archiving or disposing should be informed or driven by participants depending on project type.

##What data do I have and where is it?

Think thoroughly about what types of data live where, in order to plan for proper project closure.  

Be sure to consider all the places where data might be collected/stored. Data can live on paper, mobile devices, centralised (cloud-based) databases, distributed databases (Excel/Access/other applications across individual laptops), etc. Think about whether some of your colleagues might have copies of the data or parts of it on a private device, for example a mobile phone. Remember also that anything you have ever emailed may still be on the mail server - who does this belong to?

You may have gone through a data cleaning process to responsibly share and publish your data, but raw data and metadata may still exist on personal laptops or mobile devices.

**Tips on hosted data**

If you are using third-party applications for data collection or storage, your data is likely hosted by an external provider. It will be important to work with the external provider (**before** you sign a Service Level Agreement) to plan how data will be archived or disposed of at the end of the data cycle.

If you are using open-source applications, you probably also host the data within your organisation (but you may also be using an external provider). Either way, ensure you know where your data is and that you have a process agreed upon with regards to how to dispose of or archive it.

Data archiving and disposing is not always a simple process. It will be important to plan the time, resources and budget necessary to responsibly protect your data through the end of the lifecycle.

##What if I want to keep the data forever?

A good principle developed from the information security community is to only have the data you need for the time when you need it. You may be tempted to keep your data forever just in case you need it someday. However, the technology, data and political landscape is constantly shifting, and you don't know if it will be possible to use the information to harm someone or some group in the future. If it is important to keep the data forever, you must plan for resources to continually update and support safe data management practices for the data.

##Disposing of data

The key to disposing of your information is knowing where your data is in order to delete all of it (see above on 'what data do I have and where is my data').

Deleting digital information is more than just clicking "delete", but it is not hard to do. As a general rule, everything that is on a hard drive needs to be overwritten several times (there are free tools to help you do this) -EXAMPLE? . But if your needs are more specific, do not hesitate to reach out to an expert to help you complete the process.

##Archiving data

Archiving is a general term for the range of practices and decisions that support the long-term preservation, use, and accessibility of content with enduring value. It is not a one-time action, but is instead a process and an investment that connects directly to your projects' goals.

###Should you archive your data?

 You may want to archive your information if it has enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Preserving information has the potential to support the protection of rights, to seek redress, and to support reconciliation or recovery in damaged societies.

###Planning for your data to be archived

Try to identify as early as possible that you want archive, what you want to archive and where you want to archive. When you are at the closing stage, it may be overwhelming to solve all arising problems, while having limited time before you need to move on.

Ideally you will identify the metadata that you need about the information you are collecting so that you don't need to collect too much and you don't collect too little.

Try to store data to be archived in popular (=interoperable) formats which are likely to be used in future (for example, they are used by popular software). Over the course of a few years formats may go out of use and software systems become unable to use the data.

Keep in mind that videos can be very large, so you need to make sure that you have the infrastructure or support in place to accommodate this data (see potential archive partners below).

###Where do you archive?

If you archive data yourself, you will need to consider the cost, time and skills that will be required to maintain the archival system. This is not for the faint of data-heart! See (and learn intimately) the section A **home for healthy data** and include data storage capacity into your long-term organisational strategy.

Alternatively, it might be useful to partner directly with an archive that will help you in the public interest, such as:

* The Open Society Archives http://www.osaarchivum.org/
* Duke University Human Rights Archive http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/human-rights/
* Human Rights Web Archive at Columbia University http://hrwa.cul.columbia.edu/
* University of Texas Libraries' Human Rights Documentation Initiative http://www.lib.utexas.edu/hrdi
* Archivists without Borders http://www.arxivers.org/en/asf_internacional.php
