Rapid changes in the way that information functions in development programming demands a careful consideration of responsible data challenges and practices. This requires engagement and input from all various expertise and perspectives across project teams, but will be the most efficient and impactful if addressed in project design. Here follow a few tips to help you get started on the right path.  

##Baking 'responsible data' into your project design: where to start?

Project design can, if done well, translate seemingly 'fluffy' principles into tangible, concrete steps and activities. It can help narrow down a possibly bewildering array of tools and techniques into those best suited for achieving responsible outcomes, and set the scene for how you and your colleagues and partners will interact with data.

Here are some top tips to help you get your responsible design hat on.

- **Don't design alone**: Think carefully about who needs to be in the room, and engage the various stakeholders or experts as soon as possible (eg. it's usually a bad idea to bring specialists like techies or lawyers into planning processes after essential components have already been decided and can no longer be refined). Make sure that if you're asking people for their input, there is still space to incorporate said input into the project. Otherwise, you're wasting everyone's time.

- Plan ahead: map the lifecycle of the relevant project or system - it might change, but it's good to have a starting point.

- Keep a timeline in mind: Consider what a reasonable timespan might be- how long do you want to future proof the practice or the system for? Be realistic here: it's impossible to know what's around the corner, but there are things you can do.

- Factor in data: Fill in the points when data may be relevant in this lifecycle and what the design implications are

- Wait...why data?: Think through the options for how data can be handled or processed at each point, and - importantly - consider alternatives to the obvious or usual way of doing things before deciding it is in fact the best approach

- Get permission: Consider what permissions, consents, policies or principles might dictate or affect the handling of data and the ability of end users to make informed decisions

- Plan for failure: Build in backstops, contingency and emergency plans for when things go horribly wrong (including a resource list for troubleshooting issues)

- Budget what you need: Ensure that the financial budgeting and the allocation of human resources are "fit for purpose" and adequate to achieve all of these objectives

- Check yourself: give yourself opportunities for monitoring and calibrating, and don't wait for the project to be shut down before learning lessons and parsing failures. Periodically check whether you are staying true to the responsible data standards and ethical framework that you set for yourself up front.

- Document the process: track both the small and big picture approach to have a clear, organisational baseline that can be relied upon as people come and go and the project evolves. This will also make it much easier for you to draw out lessons learned from the project.
