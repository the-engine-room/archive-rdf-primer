Once data is collected, it can be released in a variety of ways, from closed networks within an organisation, to platform-dependent sharing between peer organisations, to publishing with closed licenses, to publishing with fully open licenses. It's often tempting to think that making data available to the widest possible audience is the best way to maximize that data's impact. This approach can also be motivated by the desire to do justice to all the hard work put into collecting, cleaning, verifying and analysing. However, it's worth carefully considering the various forms that sharing can take.

Models for sharing can differ both qualitatively and quantitatively, and there are various levels of sharing that you can adopt. Sharing may be an optional or a mandatory activity, depending on the source of funding or sponsorship, the nature of the organization, the type of data involved and other factors. It can include information about the original exercise and purpose for which the data was collected, but can always be repurposed by others, sometimes for purposes contrary to the project that first shares.

##Benefits and limitations of sharing

There are many obvious benefits to sharing data. Doing so can maximize the impact of data (or conclusions drawn from it), inform collaboration, provide stronger evidence for advocacy, increase efficiency of service delivery among a wider audience than just within your project, or play a role in decision making within other projects, to name just a few potential benefits.

Publishing your data can also allow people who might not have otherwise been well-informed enough about your project, to have a say - for example, those who are reflected in the data. Without the data being made 'open' and accessible to them, their information channels about what is happening in their communities might be severely limited: put otherwise, providing them with proactive access to information is a crucial step towards empowering them to make their opinions known.

Sharing, in the sense of publishing open data, is also an increasing trend. The open data and open government movements, as part of pushes for better transparency and accountability, as well as recent interest in shared measurement for project evaluation, are just some examples of how the international norm for sharing data has gained powerful traction in recent years.

Sharing can also have unintended consequences, however. Once data is published, it's impossible to anticipate how it might be shared further, and once it's out in the open, there's no telling how it will be adopted, re-purposed and re-used for any number of purposes. These might be positive purposes, finding uses for your data that you had never imagined yourself. But, some of these purposes might be malicious or run counter to your project's strategic objectives, and others might call into question the premises on which your project work was conducted. Still others might expose your data to new audiences and new risks.

Given our inability to see into the future, it's especially important to think carefully about what kind of data gets shared, and the relationships, licenses and agreements that govern limited sharing. Apart from the ethical implications of unforeseen use by others, there may be practical considerations: for example, participants seeing that their data is used in a way they don't agree with, or that puts them in danger, might mean that they refuse to participate in subsequent research or development efforts, either with you or with other data-intensive projects generally. As you can imagine, this has much wide societal consequences, and deserves careful thought and work to avoid such a situation.

Sometimes, technical measures to strip identifiers, redact sensitive information or otherwise "anonymise" data may be sufficient to mitigate against such potential harm. De-identification is problematic, however, and rarely works as a magic bullet.[ For a thorough discussion on this, see the section about **Anonymizing Data**.]

The bottom line here is that you should carefully consider the implications of sharing (from the point of view of the people to whom the data relates, as well as the bigger picture), whether to share at all, and the licensing conditions or terms and tools that you can use to reduce the risk of harm, while still permitting beneficial outcomes.

##Whose data is it anyway?

Many will argue that data should belong to the people who have provided it through reporting, answering surveys or simply by using devices and media that generate a data trail. This implies that data subjects have a right to be informed and consulted about how their data is used, and to require that their explicit consent be obtained for specified purposes and be refreshed for each new purpose beyond the scope of the original consent. However, this norm is difficult to operationalise in many situations: for example, among communities with low levels of data literacy, or in particularly rural and hard to reach areas.  

Others argue that data subjects have rights associated with the **result** of analyses conducted on the data, in addition to those associated with the raw data itself. These sorts of secondary data rights may suggest entirely different ways of engaging with data subjects and participants, and the ways in which consent is operationalised.

It will inevitably be up to individual projects to determine what kinds of data rights are appropriate in specific instances. It will be important that these decisions are made explicit when data is shared or published, and that appropriate licenses or agreements are applied.  (See chapter: Power to the People)

##Legal and contractual frameworks

Legal systems often include some version of a *purpose limitation principle*, in which data collected for one purpose cannot be used for any other purpose without the consent of the data subject. This is often seen as a way of respecting boundaries and choices.

Data sharing can often challenge this foundational principle. If, at the data collection stage, another common principle of data minimisation (collect no more than you need for that specified purpose) was also ignored, this problem is compounded. Having collected too much data is problematic, but potentially unproblematic, as long as the data is kept in-house. This is another reason you need to think carefully before you publish or share more widely however-  see section Sharing Data.

For sharing data with a limited set of actors, it is worth considering whether data sharing should be governed by explicit agreements such as MoUs, or even contracts. Agreements are imperfect solutions insofar as enforcing them is rarely simple, and any breach means that the data is already out of the bag, but they also have some advantages. Entering into agreements about the conditions, limitations and ethical guidelines that govern data sharing can impose some measure of control, and can also establish a shared set of expectations and revealpreviously unforeseeen risks. Highly explicit agreements about risk and responsibility can also be shared further down the chain of actors with whom data might be shared and reinforce awareness about a responsible data approach among actors not directly within your project's sphere of influence.
