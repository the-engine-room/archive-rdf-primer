So you want to publish your data - here we'll take a look at various options for formats, platforms to use, licensing and whether or not to make the data 'open'.

##Open vs Closed

You might have heard of the buzz around 'open data' - but what does this actually mean?

>According to the Open Definition (http://opendefinition.org/): open data can be **freely used, modified, and shared** by **anyone** for **any purpose**

This means that **published data**, or **online** data is not necessarily **open data**. For example - data that is published as an Excel table within a PDF document, without an open license (more on this below) - is not open data, because it can't be easily managed or re-used. Whether or not you want to 'open' your data is an important consideration.

There are many benefits to open data:

* It can be easily re-used and re-purposed for complimentary development and social good activities, saving resources and avoiding duplication.
* It can be a means of building capacities and standards for evidence among development and non-profit organizations.
* It encourages transparency and encourages accountability to participants, beneficiaries, peers and data subjects.
* It can be verifed and quality controlled by a larger group of interested parties.
* It can also be easily combined with other datasets to address longstanding problems, and reveal patterns that might not have been obvious in isolated data sets.

However, making data 'open' also allows potentially malicious actors to use the data for their purposes: this is really important to bear in mind. As the saying goes - the best thing to do with your data will be thought of by someone else... but this also means that, potentially, the worst thing to do with your data will also be thought of by someone else.

>CASE STUDY: School attendance

>In Country X, there was a region where, in certain schools, the school attendance of girls aged between 12-15 was unexpectedly low. The Ministry of Education ran advocacy and information campaigns to families, trying to highlight the importance of girls' education - but there was no change. The problem was only solved when open data sets from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health were combined: it turned out that all of the schools that didn't have proper sanitary facilities were experiencing the drop in girl's attendance. When the girls started menstruation, they had to stay at home, and this led to a big drop off in their attendance after they had missed so much school so regularly. The Ministry of Health installed proper sanitary facilities in the schools, and the girl's attendance returned to normal levels.

##Licensing

Regardless of whether you choose to make your data 'open' or not, there are a number of different licenses that you can use for your data. Some aren't included within the Open Definition, because they specify what kinds of activities (eg. for commercial purposes) the data can be used for, and according to the Open Definition anyone should be able to do whatever they like with the data.

It's important to think about licensing for a number of reasons: firstly, **if you don't license your data properly, others won't know if or how they can use it in their work**, so they might either have to get in contact with you to check first, or they might simply decide not to use it. If you've decided to put the data online to help others in their work, this would be a shame!

Secondly, **licensing makes it clear how you want your data to be used**. You might want to retain rights to attribution of it, or simply let people do whatever they want with it. If you choose to retain attribution, it makes it easier for you to see how your data has been used by other parties - this can be interesting to demonstrate the impact of the data that you collected (for example, has it been used to support other development efforts?) - or to identify uses of it that you might not have thought of. Keeping tabs on your data also means you are maintaining some level of accountability to the data owners.

>**Types of licenses**
Broadly speaking, there are two main fields of license you can choose from: Creative Commons Licenses, and the Open Data Commons licenses (http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/).
Creative Commons Licenses are more commonly used for content rather than raw data - for example, photos, text, reports. They have a nice online 'License Chooser' which will help you pick the right one for you:  https://creativecommons.org/choose/.
The Open Data Commons licenses were specifically created for databases, so might be more relevant here. There are two basic options: Public Domain Dedication License, or PDDL, which puts all of your material in the public domain (ie. for anyone to use), or the Share-Alike (plus Attribution) option, the Open Database License (ODbL). Here's a set of Frequently Asked Questions about the Open Data Commons licenses  (http://opendatacommons.org/faq/licenses/#General)  and here is some more information on Open Data Licensing ( http://opendefinition.org/guide/data/.)

##Publishing to the IATI standard

The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) represents a tremendous push for open and transparent data in the international development sector. Initially created as a process through which donors and partner governments could publish their aid flow data, it has quickly become a data standard through which a number of organisations (donors, large and small NGOs, recipient countries and governments) can put their data online in an interoperable way. (More about IATI here: http://www.aidtransparency.net/about) .

There are a number of reasons that organisations should be enthusiastic about publishing to IATI. It's an important moment for transparency and accountability, and an opportunity to strengthen organisation's data practices. There are risks to consider as well, however.

Recently, there has been a push for traceability and increased granularity within geocoded data - ie, more detail on where exactly projects are taking place. This would, in theory, allow for more people to keep a closer eye on where exactly money is being spent - is it going where it is saying it is going? But pushing for more granular geocoded data might, in some cases, require a risk assessment first. For example, if an NGO in a country is doing projects that are seen as 'troublemaking' by the government in power at the time, providing them (or anyone) with details on where exactly the projects are taking place might put project implementers in danger.

>CASE STUDY

>In an effort to increase transparency and reduce corruption, the government of a small African country is thinking about making it mandatory for all NGOs working in the country to publish to IATI. This would include project documents, details of financial budgeting and spending, and potentially geocoded data of where project activities are taking place, too. By employing a 'publish by default' strategy, they want to show to international donors that they are truly committed to rooting out financial corruption in the country. However, the government also has some restrictive human rights policies in place - and also has a history of political instability, meaning that those in positions of power change frequently. Activities that are deemed 'suitable' by NGOs within this political climate could change suddenly, leaving those NGOs and their constituents in danger by publishing their activities to IATI. The government uses the argument that organisations can ask for exemptions if they don't feel comfortable publishing their activities, but in many of these cases, asking for an exemption not to publish might be interpreted as a signal to government that they are engaging in "unlawful" activities. So here, publish by default has some hidden, potentially dangerous consequences.

While increasing transparency and encouraging accountability around aid activities is clearly a good move, it is crucial to bear in mind the potential risks and outlying cases through which publishing to IATI might put people in danger. The IATI community is made up of people who have vast amounts of knowledge about the data produced and used by global development organisations across the world - if you have a person tasked with publishing your organisation's data to IATI in your organisation, it might be worth sitting down with them to discuss exactly what is being published, and what is not.
