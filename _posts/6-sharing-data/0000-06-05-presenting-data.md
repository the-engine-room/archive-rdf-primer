##Power and the visual

There are many ways of presenting data: from infographics to narrative reports, case studies and long form investigative articles, to graffiti or conceptual art. The list goes on, but what's important is that different media bring different ethical and moral challenges with them when transforming data into message.

No data is neutral, and presenting information can reveal even more biases. Use data as accurately as possible, and take care not to misrepresent topics or skew the data in order to suit your particular advocacy or campaigning need - it will make for an unreliable and easily discreditable campaign, and it will probably put your organisation's reputation at risk. More importantly, you are breaking the agreement with the people you are representing.

Visual and narrative manipulation and misrepresentation of data, be it by chance or on purpose, is an issue of great importance. Publishing your data is often the last mile, and can be the culmination of the whole project. Digging deep into visual wizardry is outside of the scope of this book; however we warmly suggest reading up on the subject before going public. A very good starting point is Mushon Zer Aviv's short essay "How to lie with data visualisation": https://visualisingadvocacy.org/blog/disinformation-visualization-how-lie-datavis

##Power and representation

In most initiatives dealing with development, vulnerability and marginalisation are critical issues for the people we work with. As with other elements concerning data, inclusion of marginalised people is something we have to be sensitive to.  Examples of these groups could include women, persons living with disabilities, LGBTI communities, people from certain geographical areas or people of different racial, ethnic and cultural backgrounds.

When presenting data, ensure that these groups are appropriately treated and they are not being omitted, trivialised, judged or romanticised. Be intentional in how they are represented and what this means for your participants and beyond.

>CASE STUDY: “I know where your school is”

>A local NGO was involved in investigating and documenting human rights activities. They used the results to pressure their own government. One of their initiatives was to interview people on camera and produce a documentary about the country - seeking to give voice to victims. To protect the participants, they took steps to keep their identities secret and told them their stories would not be traceable to them as individuals. The NGO subsequently put this documentary online to expose the issue and feed into their other advocacy activities. However, they had little experience in editing video and and when they release the footage, faces were blurred but not sufficiently (e.g. when people got up or moved on their seats, their faces would be visible for a few instances) and it had not been considered that victims speaking about what exactly perpetrators had done to them would mean they could be identified even without their name having been stated (since at a minimum, the actual perpetrator could identify their victims when testifying a certain level of detail). They also failed to consider the danger in the footage of easily recognizable location features (such a school signs in the background, or buildings which can be easily found through Google Maps or Earth and lead to identification). In at least one case, an interviewee who had given testimony was re-victimized by subsequently getting detained by government forces and badly beaten.

>Lessons:

> * Do not assume that the consent of the person you are documenting also means you do not need to check that they fully understand the risks and potential implications
> * Your staff should make the final decision if it is safe to release or not and they should have been trained and empowered to do so responsibly
>(Note on not patronising people: it is important to respect people’s agency while minimising risks to them. So it may not be your call to make to prevent someone from telling their story - even if it entails risks - as long as the person fully understands that. It is, however, your responsibility to make sure that when they think they will not be recognisable, they really are not!)

>Mitigation:

> * Consider potential risk of the use of information you collect
> * Make sure to consult the people who actually understand the context and what sensitivity means in it
