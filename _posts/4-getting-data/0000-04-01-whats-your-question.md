Any evidence-based project relies on the complex, nuanced and deeply important process of collecting data. This chapter will address considerations around data collection: from defining your question, through to practical procedures for dealing with new and found data, to questions of agency, consent and privacy.

Determining the questions that you are trying to answer is the most important part of a data collection process. Data should always be gathered for a reason: namely, because you think the answer to your question lies within. You may be asking simple **factual** questions (eg. how many students graduate from a school annually), or questions that are **divergent** or **evaluative** (what impact did the change in curriculum have on students graduating from a school).  No matter how simple or how complex, **knowing the question that you are trying to answer is fundamental**.  

The next step is to determine where to find information that will most effectively help you answer your question.  There are two main ways of getting hold of data:

**Using existing data** – data that has already been released and is publicly available, like a government census. This group also covers accessing non-released existing data (like through Freedom of Information requests), or taking data from existing sources that hasn't been clearly packaged for research purposes, like scraping social media sources like Twitter and Facebook.

**Collecting new data** – gathering data directly from the subject (e.g. doing a survey of students and teachers in a school) or generating new data, potentially indirectly (e.g. logging GPS pings of staff cell phones while on specific missions).  

No matter where data come from, **try your best to ensure that it is good data**. While there are many things to keep in mind about data quality, the most basic ones are **accuracy**, **validity** and **timeliness**. These are extremely important aspects of using data responsibly, but the technical sides to these, for example on data collection techniques and metholodgy, fall outside the scope of this book. Never fear though - there are many sources on this issue that can be referred to for help.
