There are many ways to store data that vary in terms of convenience and security. How you store your data should be measured against the particular risks you or your partners may be facing, and your personal priorities: for example, are you more concerned about data loss, or surveillance? These are extremely important questions. Perhaps it isn't so important to you if authorities have access to your data, but it would be disastrous if the data were somehow destroyed.

Remember: no method of storing data is 100% safe, so it is **essential** that you backup your data, no matter how or where it is stored.  

Data storage

There are a few areas to take into consideration as you make decisions on storage and these could include:

* **Physical location:** Where should data be stored given the type of data and the potential vulnerabilities? Within the country you're working in, or in another country, and what are the implications of both of these? (eg. differing legal jurisdictions, local internet regulations, especially with regards to storing sensitive data)
* **Digital location:** Should data be stored on‐line or off‐line or both? Or is it open data? (see: The Sharing Spectrum)
* **Ultimate ownership of storage:** Consider pros/cons of third party data storage vs local data storage (e.g. do you have local capacity for local data storage; what is the desired uptime; etc.)
* **Back ups:** what level of data back‐ups are required? (you can never back up too much!)
Access: ensure storage method allows for the necessary levels of access. (see: For Your Eyes Only)
* **Data lifecycle:** what is the data lifecycle and who will manage it until the end of the data's life? (if it ends!)
* **Saving data:** what is the data access / data saving policy, especially for sensitive data (e.g. if data must be downloaded locally it must be encrypted, etc.)

##Pros and cons of storage options

Some of the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches may be:

###Locally on your PC(s)

**Advantages:**  high security if encrypted, fast and always accessible, easier version control, greater legal clarity over ownership

**Disadvantages:** lower security if physical theft or confiscation is an issue, poor backup, bad resiliency in terms of physical emergencies - fires or floods for example,  poor access except for people located near the machines, potential increase in time spent maintaining the system versus working with a specialist provider.

###On your own network

**Advantages:** increased resilience, easier sharing and collaboration, better backup, greater legal clarity

**Disadvantages:** increased cost, greater skill needed for effective security, greater reliance on IT support team or third party contractor, potential exposure still to confiscation

###Living in the cloud

**Advantages:** decreased costs, increased resilience, easier sharing and collaboration, less downtime, better backup, specialist provider knowledge

**Disadvantages:** increased legal uncertainty, no control over physical access, nearly impossible to vet people with access to the servers, reliant on cloud company policies which may change

If using cloud hosts, you should ideally identify those who have previous experience in:

* Providing secure access and protection for your information
* Supporting the tools which you wish to use
* Providing good and fast support to their customers - find people who come recommended from trusted members of your network
* Demonstrable and veriable commitment to privacy
* Working with other projects in the humanitarian or human rights field
* Working within the legal jurisdiction you need
* Protecting physical data: securing your information from theft, damage and loss

For many people, information security often makes them think only of digital data. However, physical data protection is a vital process, as gaining physical access to data often requires less technical skill than a cyber threat and can often be an easier strategy for a potential adversary.

Imagine if your office or home were burned down or broken into today - what would you wish you had thought of in advance? Some things to think about include the following:

* Location of data: the physical security of locations where you store physical data (such as paper) or physical media (such as laptops, USB sticks, DVDs, SD Cards, hard-drives). Are they all in the same location, and easy to find and gain access to?
* Access to sensitive locations: who has access to your office, home and working environment. Especially to areas of highest sensitivity such as server rooms, research desks, consultation rooms, meeting rooms etc. Consider using high-grade locks, CCTV, fences etc.
* Installing appropriate fire safety controls
* External staff: vetting all staff and contractors such as cleaners or security guards
* Using an inventory: creating and consistently updating an inventory, to enable you to be able to identify any loss or theft of data.
* Building a security incident registry: This should be filled out if any member of staff physically sees anything suspicious or has an unusual incident occurring with their IT equipment. It allows for monitoring and identification of incident patterns which may otherwise have been missed. For help in identifying suspicious digital incidents, see http://digitaldefenders.org/digitalfirstaid/
* Getting rid of physical waste: regularly shredding and disposing of any paper waste
* Regularly changing security procedures: for example, changing keys, cards, pin codes or other access control mechanisms, particularly following a change of staff.
